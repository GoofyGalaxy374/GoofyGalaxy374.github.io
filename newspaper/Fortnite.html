	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:150%;"> Fortnite review </p>
	<p> Fortnite is a co-op sandbox survival game developed by Epic Games and People Can Fly and published by Epic Games. 
The game was released as a paid-for early access title for <i>Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4</i> and <i>Xbox One</i> 
on July 25, 2017, with a full free-to-play release expected in 2018. The retail versions of the game were published by 
Gearbox Publishing, while online distribution of the PC versions is handled by Epic's launcher.
 Fortnite is set in contemporary Earth, where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98% of the world's 
population to disappear, and zombie-like creatures rise to attack the remainder. 
Considered by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead, Fortnite has up to four players cooperating on 
various missions on randomly-generated maps to collect resources, build fortifications around defensive objectives 
that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors, and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat 
with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives. Players gain rewards through these missions 
to improve their hero characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on 
more difficult missions. The game is supported through microtransactions to purchase in-game currency that can be 
used towards these upgrades.</p>

 <p>A standalone mode, Fortnite Battle Royale, based on the battle royale game genre but based on the core Fortnite 
gameplay, was released for the same platforms in September 2017.
 Some for Gameplay:
 Currently, the paid-for product Fortnite provides two distinct modes: access to Fortnite Battle Royale, 
(which is also available as a separate free-to-play title) and the cooperative player-versus-environment 
"Save the World", which is unique to the main Fortnite game.</p>

<p>The "Save the World" mode is described as a co-op sandbox survival game and is about exploration, scavenging items, 
crafting weapons, building fortified structures, and fighting waves of encroaching monsters. Tim Sweeney, Epic's 
founder, described the game as "Minecraft meets Left 4 Dead". The game cycles between managing one's resources at 
a safe home base, and then going out on missions to complete quests as to collect resources and obtain rewards to 
advance the game's story.</p>

<p>In the meta-game, the player has an inventory of weapon and trap schematics, hero characters, defender characters, 
and support characters, along with collected resources. Schematics are used to construct weapons and traps when on 
the field. Hero characters represent characters from one of four classes that the player can use while on a mission, 
as well as used to undertake resource-gathering missions making them unavailable to use until they return from the mission. 
Defender characters can be summoned to help with defense but only if there are less than four players on a mission. 
Support characters are used to form various non-playable squads that provide passive bonuses to the player's attack
strength, building speed, armor, and health, with additional benefits if the player can match certain characterization 
attributes within a squad. The player can spend different types of experience points and resources earned as mission
rewards, from loot boxes (represented as llama pinatas), or other sources to level up and evolve schematics and 
characters. For weapons and traps, this generally boosts their effectiveness as well as unlocking additional attribute 
bonuses, while leveling up hero characters will unlock special skills the character has while in the field. Schematics 
and characters are generally assigned a rarity, which determines how much they can be leveled and evolved. A player's 
inventory of schematics and characters is limited, but players can opt to slot anyone they do not need into a collection 
book to gain rewards when certain collection sets are completed; use one or more of these schematics or characters to 
transform them into a new random item, or simply retire them to gain back experience points and other resources to 
free up the inventory slots.</p>

<p>The player also can spend skill points, earned by completing missions, and technology points, earned over time, 
to unlock new skills and technologies in the game's skill and technologies trees. These can improve a player's base 
attributes, attributes that are shared with the other players while on missions, unlock higher levels of evolution 
for schematics and characters, open up new squad positions, or unlock general skills that players can use in the field.
Collectively, the player's progress on these skill and technology trees, their squad composition, and their selected
hero character make up the player's current "power level" which relates to what difficulty of missions the player 
should take and the game's matchmaking services. Also, players can review their current story progress and quests, 
which can include daily, side, and event quests, which when completed provide in-game currency or resources.
Mission is currently divided between four world locations, some available only after progressing far enough in the 
story, and special locations for timed events and for the Survive the Storm mode. Within a location are several 
possible mission areas that show the type of mission, the terrain it takes place on, its difficulty rating relative 
to the player's current power level, and whether the mission is currently under special "storm" conditions that throw 
random effects, like buffed husks or mini-bosses, into the mission but have potentially better rewards if completed. 
The player optionally can select a special site that automatically matches them with players at a similar power level 
and story progression on a random mission for added rewards.
Most missions take place on procedurally-generated landscapes. Most missions are based on locating site representing 
the objectives on the map, build up fortifications around those locations, and then face off against several waves of
husks that will try to destroy the objectives. During completion of these missions, players are generally given a 
"storm forecast" to know where husks will spawn in as to enhance fortification in that direction, though this direction 
can change in more difficult missions. Other missions are time-limited, requiring the players to locate and help a number 
of survivors, build out several radar towers, or clear out various encampment of husks scattered around the map before 
time runs out. These missions encourage the players to explore the map and farm for resources (either by searching 
objects or destroying them with an axe) used to build the fortifications, weapons, ammunition, and traps needed to 
defend or attack the husks. Players also frequently need to seek out bluglo, a special resource that does not carry 
over between maps to activate certain mission objectives. Some missions are considered a loss if the objective is 
destroyed or time runs out, while other missions allow the players to rework their fortifications and start their 
defense again if the objective is destroyed. Maps will frequently have optional objectives that are discovered 
through exploration, such as human survivors that need help. Completing these successfully earn immediate in-game 
rewards such as resources, weapons, and traps. Missions themselves may provide bonus objectives, such as by 
completing the mission within a certain in-game period, using a limited number of fortification pieces, or saving 
more survivors than the minimum necessary, which affects the qualify of rewards the players receive after the 
successful completion of the main mission.
During missions, players can make their fortifications from one of three base materials (wood, brick, and metal), 
and in a number of configurations, including floors/ceilings, walls, stairs, and ramps; players have the ability to 
edit these for more configurations, such as adding a door or window to a wall. Each fortification part can be upgraded
with more resources of the same type to improve their durability, and when they are damaged, can be repaired by 
spending additional resources. Traps, which have a limited number of activation before they fall apart, can be placed 
on floors, walls, and ceilings, and arranged in means to make them more lethal or effective against husks. Traps may 
also include beneficial resources for players, such as healing pads, defender posts, and launch pads. Similarly, 
players can use a range of weapons but these have limited durability that drops as they are used or as a penalty if 
the player should be downed by husks and need to respawn without the help of allies. Players can construct new weapons, 
ammo, and traps from gathered resources, or find these from searching containers across the map. During missions, 
the game progresses through an accelerated day-night cycle; during the day, the husks are more passive and do not 
generally pose immediate threats, while during the night, bands of husks may spawn in and will aggressively seek 
out players.
One unique mission type is Storm Shield Defense missions. In each of the four world locations, the player is allocated 
a map that remains persistent, representing the site where their base's storm shield generator is placed, and in the 
storm mode, the player must return to this map to expand the storm shield, requiring them to add a new objective to 
defend successfully to continue the story. At any time, the player can enter this map without starting</p>
